### About

Big successes of machine learning (ML) for molecules have been achieved recently, e.g. the accurate prediction of protein 3D structure (Jumper 2021; Thornton, 2021), discovery of novel antibiotics (Stokes, 2020; Das, 2021), or chemical synthesis planning (Segler, 2018). These successes make molecular machine learning one of the prime candidates to tackle the climate-, energy- and pandemic-related crisis that we are facing. Nevertheless, there are still major challenges and  substantial critique is voiced on current methods that are based mostly on deep learning (Marcus, 2018). Deep learning (DL) methods are data hungry, have limited knowledge transfer capabilities, do not quickly adapt to changing tasks or distributions, insufficiently incorporate world and prior knowledge, and cannot inherently distinguish causation from correlation (Bengio, 2021; Chollet, 2019; Marcus, 2018; Sch√∂lkopf, 2019). Furthermore, the current models are usually not composable in a sense that sub-components or different modules can be combined in a new way. With these characteristics, the machine learning systems currently employed for molecules are of the type of a narrow artificial intelligence (AI) (Chollet, 2019; Hochreiter, 2022). The above-mentioned drawbacks hold in particular for molecular machine learning, such as activity and property prediction, generative modeling (Yang, 2017; Bender, 2021; Fan, 2022), chemical reactivity and synthesis (Segler, 2018; Seidl, 2022), and molecular modeling (Bereau, 2013) and representation learning.    

Therefore, this workshop focuses on exposing the current limitations of machine learning methods for molecules by critically assessing them, either theoretically or in applied and in industrial settings. The methods contributed to this workshop can focus on architectures that are robust against domain shifts, such as new biotechnologies or types of molecules. The proposed methods can also focus on quickly adapting to newly acquired data with potentially expensive biotechnologies, concretely few- and zero-shot learning methods. A further theme of the workshop is on methods that lead to new levels of abstractions of molecule representations, such that broader generalization capabilities are enabled. A potential step in this direction are machine learning methods for creating relevant physical abstractions, e.g. for improving molecular dynamics simulations or force fields. Advancing machine learning for molecules also means that these new systems should be able to interact with humans and transfer knowledge between them and the system, which is covered by the workshop theme on interpretability and explainability methods. The workshop also includes considerations and methodologies that allow for modularity or compositionality of architectures for molecular machine learning.
